The data is split into training and test sets.
The training set is used to train the model.
The test set is used to evaluate the model.

## Model

The model used for this project is [CatBoost Classifier](https://catboost.ai/).

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated based on their [classification accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy), the percentage of predicted labels that are correct.
